# Developer Quick Start Guide

So you want to help us bring Linux to M1 Macs? Read on! This guide describes the recommended set-up for developing for Linux on an M1.

This guide is meant for developers who want to hack on Asahi Linux. It is not representative of what the install process for end-users will look like. It is meant for experienced Linux developers who may not know anything about Macs or M1 machines.

It is extremely unlikely that you will damage your computer by following these steps, but we can make no guarantees at this time. Please proceed under your own responsibility.

## Introduction

### Objective

We will be setting up a dual-boot M1 computer with two OSes: a vanilla macOS install (optionally with reduced/permissive security), and a "stub" macOS install with permissive security that will serve as a boot wrapper for Linux (or anything else we want to run through m1n1). You will also learn about what options are available to get a hardware serial console.

### Prerequisites

* An Apple M1 machine 
    We recommend the Mac Mini as a baseline target. 
    * Mac Mini: Does not require Type C power, has additional on-board PCIe hardware (Ethernet & xHCI for type A ports). Requires an HDMI monitor.
    * Macbook Air: USB via DWC3/Type-C only. Built-in screen. SPI keyboard. Requires Type C power for charging.
    * Macbook Pro: Like the Air, but with a Touch Bar replacing the F keys, which means your keyboard will be crippled until the drivers for that are written.

* macOS installed on the machine (we assume you will start from a stock configuration with a single macOS partition)
    * No FileVault (encryption). This will just complicate things and is not tested.

* A Linux development machine (any architecture)
    * If not arm64: an `aarch64-linux-gnu` gcc crosscompiler/toolchain (clang is also supported to build m1n1 but less tested).

Highly recommended:
  
* A serial port solution. Read on for that.

### TL;DR on M1 Mac Boot

Storage: the internal SSD is a GPT partitioned disk containing (initially) APFS containers, each of which contains multiple APFS volumes.

The boot process:

1. SecureROM (Boot ROM) in M1 silicon starts
    * Either enters DFU mode (USB recovery) or
    * Boots iBoot1 from NOR (SPI) flash
2. iBoot1 (global) looks for boot policies in iSC Preboot and tries to boot the active one from its OS APFS Preboot volume (as defined in NVRAM)
    * If the power button is held down, boots 1TR instead
    * This is what initializes the screen and shows the Apple logo
3. iBoot2 (per-OS copy; ~= OS loader) boots the OS
    * Loads auxiliary CPU engine firmwares from OS APFS Preboot partition
    * Then loads a mach-o kernel wrapped in an img4 container from the Preboot partition
    * This is in charge of adjusting and passing in the ADT (Apple Device Tree)
4. The OS kernel (XNU/Darwin) boots
    * Mounts the root filesystem, etc

Read [[SW:Boot]] and [[M1 vs. PC Boot]] for more info.

Mini glossary:

* 1TR: One True Recovery: trusted system-level recovery, includes all boot user interaction too (boot picker). Lives in its own APFS container (last partition).
* APFS: Apple's fancypants filesystem
    * APFS Container: ~= ZFS pool (usually backed by a GPT partition)
    * APFS Volume: ~= ZFS dataset
    * APFS Snapshot: ~= ZFS snapshot
* AP Ticket: signed blob from Apple that allows you to run a given macOS version on a specific machine. "macOS version" ~= iBoot2 & firmware bundles. "Generic" ones available for use with reduced-security modes (i.e. no phone home requirement in that case).
* Boot Policy: declares an OS bootable on a given machine. Signed and validated by SEP (locally). Stored in iSC.
* iBoot1: First stage bootloader, finds an OS to boot
* iBoot2: Second stage bootloader, spins up on-die auxiliary core firmwares and boots the XNU kernel (or m1n1)
* iSC: iBoot System Container, APFS container with boot configs/stuff
* kernelcache: kernel + kexts blob (~=linux + initramfs containing modules)
* kext: kernel module
* NOR: SPI NOR Flash on board containing iBoot1, product customization data, nvram
* SecureROM: Boot ROM on the M1 silicon die
* SEP: Secure Enclave Processor ~= TPM or Secure Monitor in other platforms (it's a separate core here).
* SFR: System Firmware and Recovery (iBoot1 + iSC partition + 1TR partition). Downgrade protected.
* Startup Security modes
    * Full Security: Full secureboot, no non-Apple software can run except for signed & ad-hoc userspace binaries under macOS if allowed by the user, enforces AP tickets (no macOS downgrades).
    * Reduced Security: Allows third-party kexts, management, etc.
    * Permissive Security: Allows unsigned kernels (this is what we want).
* XNU: the base of Darwin, the macOS kernel

Notes:

* M1 machines do not support *any* bootloader-level user interaction or keyboard shortcuts or anything.
    * The only thing iBoot1 can see is whether you're holding down the power button or not.
    * The "boot picker" is a macOS application running under 1TR. Yes, really.
* M1 machines *cannot* boot from external storage.
    * Picking an external disk in the boot picker will *copy its entire Preboot partition to the iSC* and generate a boot policy. This is morally equivalent to having the entire /boot on Linux on internal storage. **These machines cannot boot macOS kernels from external storage, ever**, at least using current firmware.

### If things go wrong

M1 Macs are effectively unbrickable as long as you do not write to SPI Flash (we highly discourage declaring the NOR Flash in the Linux devicetree: we are not aware of any reason to touch it at this point, so all it does is massively increase the risk of catastrophe; we will proceed with caution and safeguards if it ever becomes necessary to access directly). However, they do rely on software installed on the internal SSD storage to boot normally and into 1TR.

If you end up with your Mac in an unbootable state, follow [apple's DFU recovery instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/apple-configurator-2/apdd5f3c75ad/mac). You will need another Mac running macOS to perform this process (Intel ones are fine). This should not happen if you follow the steps on this guide normally, but may happen if you end up accidentally writing to internal storage incorrectly (e.g. wiping the entire block device or screwing up the GPT partition table).

Eventually, it should be possible to use [idevicerestore](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/idevicerestore) to perform this same process from a Linux machine, but this isn't ready yet.

While DFU boot works with a totally corrupted NOR flash, vital product identification and calibration data is stored there and you cannot restore this without Apple's help; you will have to send the machine in for repairs so they can re-provision its identity and run manufacturing testing and calibration. So, stay away from touching NOR flash.

## Setup

### Step 0: Upgrade macOS

You need at least macOS 11.2. Don't bother with older versions, they won't work.

You will need to have gone through the macOS first-setup, including having created a primary administrator user/password.

### Step 1: Partitioning

You are starting here:

* disk0s1: iBoot System Container
* disk0s2: Macintosh HD (OS #1 APFS container)
* disk0s3: 1TR (One True Recovery OS)

We want to get here:

* disk0s1: iBoot System Container
* disk0s2: Macintosh HD (OS #1 macOS APFS container)
* disk0s3: Linux (OS #2 "fake macOS" APFS container)
* disk0s4: Linux /boot (FAT32)
* disk0s5: Linux / (ext4)
* disk0s6: 1TR (One True Recovery OS)

Note that storage is not yet supported in our tree or bootloader, but we are targeting this partition layout a priori. disk0s3 will be our "stub" macOS, which at this time will be used to hold a full macOS install (eventually we will provide tooling to allow this to be a minimal partition containing only boot files, to avoid wasted space, but this is not ready yet).

Assuming you have a 500GB model:

```shell
# diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 200GB
# diskutil addPartition disk0s2 APFS Linux 70GB
# diskutil addPartition disk0s5 FAT32 LB 1GB
# diskutil addPartition disk0s4 FAT32 LR 0
```

You need at least 70GB for the stub partition, because the macOS install/update process is very inefficient. This will not be necessary in the future, once we have our own setup process.

Shrinking the OS APFS partition can be done on-line.

Each invocation of `diskutil addPartition` needs to be passed the partition node
of the partition *prior* to the new partition to be created. This can vary, so
run `diskutil list` prior to every instance and pick the device name of the last
created partition. In the example above, `Linux` ended up as disk0s5 and `LB`
ended up as disk0s4. Go figure. This gets reset after a reboot.

The volume name of the stub partition will determine the OS name in the boot picker, so call it "Linux".

We can change the FS and GPT type of the true Linux root and boot partitions later.

### Step 2: Install macOS in the stub partition

Shut down the machine. Boot with the power button held down, until "Loading startup options..." appears. This enters 1TR, the OS recovery environment.

Select "Options" in the boot picker.

In the main recovery menu, select "Reinstall macOS Big Sur".

Follow the prompts, and select "Linux" as the target volume.

Wait a while. This will reboot the machine into the new OS automatically.

### Step 3: Go through initial setup

Go through OS first-time setup. Create an administrator user and password.

Check the OS version. If it is not 11.2, you should update this OS too.

Shut down the machine again.

### Step 4: Downgrade security

Boot into 1TR again ("Options" entry in the boot picker).

In the top menu bar, go to Utilities â†’ Terminal. This brings up a root shell.

Find the volume group ID of your stub partition:

```shell
# diskutil apfs listVolumeGroups | grep -B3 Linux | grep Group
```

Then downgrade security:

```shell
# bputil -nkcas
```

Select the matching OS install ID, and follow the prompts. You will need to enter the credentials that you created in step 3.

Further disable SIP for good measure. This one is nice enough to ask you to pick the OS by name:

```shell
# csrutil disable
```

At this point you are ready to use custom kernels. Congrats!

## Getting a serial console

Having a serial console is indispensable for a fast development cycle and to debug low-level issues.

M1 Macs expose their debug serial port over one of their Type C ports (the same one used for DFU). On MacBooks, this is the rear left port. On the Mac Mini, this is the port closest to the power plug.

The serial port is a UART using 1.2V logic levels, and requires vendor-specific USB-PD VDM commands to enable. Thus, making a compatible cable is nontrivial. You have the following options.

The target machine can also be hard-rebooted using USB-PD commands, making for a quick test cycle (no holding down power buttons).

See also [[HW:USB-PD]] for details on the VDM commands and what you can do with them.

### Using an M1 machine

If you have two M1 boxes, this is the simplest solution. Just grab [macvdmtool](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/macvdmtool/), connect both machines with a standard Type C cable (needs to be the USB 3 / SuperSpeed type, USB 2 only cables won't work) using the DFU port on *both* machines, and that's it!

```shell
$ xcode-select --install
$ git clone https://github.com/AsahiLinux/macvdmtool
$ cd macvdmtool
$ make
$ sudo ./macvdmtool reboot serial
```

See the macvdmtool page or just run it without arguments for a list of supported commands. Your serial port device is `/dev/cu.debug-console`.

NOTE: if you have enabled serial debug output on your host machine (via nvram settings), the serial port device will be in use by the kernel. You need to turn that off to use it as a generic serial port.

### DIY Arduino-based USB-PD interface

You can build a DIY USB-PD interface with the following parts:

* An Arduino or clone
* A FUSB302 chip, either stand-alone or on a breakout board
* A USB Type C breakout board (get a male one, plugging in directly into the target, for the most flexibility
* A 1.2V compatible UART interface

Note that most FUSB302 breakout boards will not usefully break out the Type C pins you need, so it's best to use a separate full breakout board.

Go to the [vdmtool](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/vdmtool) repository for more information and a wiring list. Documentation is a bit sparse at the moment. You can ask us on IRC (freenode/#asahi) if you need help.

1.2V compatible UART interfaces are relatively rare. 1.8V ones will usually work for input (RX); you can use a resistor divider to step down the TX voltage (`TX -- 470Î© -+- 220Î© -- GND` will step down 1.8V TX to 1.22V at the `+` point).

The default `vdmtool` code will put serial on the SBU1/SBU2 pins. At the device side connector (no cable), TX (output from the Mac) will be on the SBU1 pin on the connector side that has the active CC line (you should only connect one), and RX (input to the Mac) will be directly opposite the CC line.

This is all rather rudimentary because it's a stop-gap for the proper solution, which is...

### Flexible USB-PD Debug Interface (project name TBD)

In the coming weeks we'll be designing an open hardware interface for interfacing to M1 serial ports, and more (supporting other debug pinsets on Apple devices, as well as UARTs on other devices such as certain Android phones, etc). Stay tuned for more information. Established kernel developers who want to get an early prototype when they become available should contact [marcan](mailto:marcan@marcan.st).

## Using m1n1

m1n1 is our initial bootloader, which is in charge of pretending to be a XNU kernel and performing Apple-specific initialization.

Currently, m1n1 works as a serial "proxy" server, controlled via Python scripts from a host. In this way, you can load kernels via serial and also explore the hardware interactively, with a Python console.

### Building

You need an `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` cross-compiler toolchain (or a native one, if running on ARM64). You also need `dtc` (the devicetree compiler) and `convert` (from ImageMagick) for the boot logos.

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1.git
$ cd m1n1
$ make
```

The output will be in `build/m1n1.macho`.

### Installation

Boot your Mac into 1TR, then pull up the terminal. You can use the network to copy files over - either SSH from the Mac or just use curl.

For example, on your build machine:

```shell
$ cd m1n1/build
$ python3 -m http.server
```

And on your target machine:

```shell
# curl buildmachine.lan:8000/m1n1.macho > m1n1.macho
```

To install m1n1 into the stub partition as a custom kernelcache:

```shell
# kmutil configure-boot -c m1n1.macho -C -v /volumes/Linux
```

Type in your credentials. If everything went well, you can restart and boot into m1n1!

### Host setup

m1n1 currently requires a serial console to do anything. Go to the [getting a serial console](#getting-a-serial-console) section to learn more about available options.

**NOTE(2021-02-05)**: we will add a framebuffer console and support for built-in payloads to m1n1 to remove this requirement in the following few days, at the expense of a long test cycle (you need to re-`kmutil` every kernel you want to test). Stay tuned. USB OTG support is also planned in the future, so you will be able to interact with m1n1 with a standard USB C cable and load kernels faster.

To use the m1n1 proxyclient, you need the Python packages `pyserial` and `construct`. If your distribution does not provide them for you, you can use:

```shell
$ pip install --user pyserial construct
```

If you are on macOS, install python3.9 using Homebrew. The OS version of Python has problems with readline history files (?):

```shell
$ arch -x86_64 brew install python
$ pip3.9 install --user pyserial construct
```

### Usage

To use the proxyclient scripts, you need to set `M1N1DEVICE` to your serial port device. When using another M1 mac as the host, use `export M1N1DEVICE=/dev/cu.debug-console`.

Things to do:

#### Playground shell
