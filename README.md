## Contributing

```console
npm install
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Github Pages

```console
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
