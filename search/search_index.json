Upgrading it should seldom be needed, we'll make tooling for this when it becomes necessary. It has the PARTUUID of the EFI system partition assigned to this OS hardcoded into it (set at install time), and chainloads m1n1 stage 2 from <code>&lt;ESP&gt;/m1n1/boot.bin</code> (the ESP must be in internal NVMe storage, no external storage is supported).

This makes it easier to fit in with Apple's boot picker model, since it knows nothing about EFI; from its point of view, each Asahi instance installed is its own separate OS, and therefore downstream we use a separate ESP for each. Nothing stops you from installing multiple bootloaders or OSes within one such container/ESP, but:</p> <ul> <li>We suspect this will cause pain in the future once we start integrating with security-related platform features (e.g. SEP), since it might have a concept of \"currently booted OS identity\".</li> <li>Since there can only be one set of DTs, U-Boot, and m1n1 stage 2 version per container/ESP, there is no sane way for multiple distros to cooperate to manage updates if they share one container.</li> <li>We don't have persistent EFI variable storage (and no good idea for how to do it in runtime services), which means there's no way to manage the EFI boot order. So you end up with the default only.</li> </ul> <p>Thus, if you're adding distro support for end-users, please stick to this model. An exception is USB-bootable rescue/installer images, which should be bootable by the vanilla m1n1.bin bundle that the Asahi Linux installer installs in plain UEFI container mode, from their own ESP on the USB drive containing <code>/EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI</code> (no <code>m1n1/boot.bin</code>). Those should never try to manage the <code>boot.bin</code> in the internal ESP themselves (until/unless installed proper, thus becoming the owners of that container), and hopefully the DT situation will work out for the USB boot.</p> <p>The PARTUUID of the EFI system partition assigned to the currently booted OS is set by m1n1 as the <code>asahi,efi-system-partition</code> property of the <code>/chosen</code> device tree node, which can be read from Linux at <code>/proc/device-tree/chosen/asahi,efi-system-partition</code>. Our U-Boot branch also uses this to find the right ESP.</p>"},{"location":"alt/boot-process-guide/#version-interactions","title":"Version interactions","text":"<p>Here's where it gets a bit hairy. m1n1, u-boot, Linux, and the device trees have somewhat complex and subtle version interdependencies.</p> <ul> <li>m1n1 stage 2 is in charge of some hardware init, and patching in dynamic values into the device trees. This means that newer kernel hardware support often depends on a m1n1 update, either to initialize things or to add more device tree data, or both.<ul> <li>In general, we prefer to keep Linux drivers simple and put \"magic\" init (e.g. random magic sets of register writes, which Apple loves to describe in their variant of a DT) in m1n1. Same with things related to the memory controller, clock configurations that we can reasonably leave static, etc. The exception is when Linux has no choice but to do this dynamically at runtime. Apple likes to leave way too much to the XNU kernel (which m1n1 replaces), including ridiculous things like turning on the system-level L3 cache, and we don't want Linux to have to deal with that. This also highly increases our chances of existing kernels working (at least partially) on newer SoCs/platforms with only DT changes, which is good for e.g. forward-compatibility of distro install images. For example, PCIe on M2 required no driver-level changes, only changes to the m1n1 initialization.</li> </ul> </li> <li>U-Boot generally doesn't change much once properly brought up on any given SoC, and only cares about a subset of DT info.</li> <li>Linux needs DT data to bring up hardware, so new hardware needs DT updates. Our canonical DT repository is part of our Linux tree itself, but remember changes here often need m1n1 (stage 2) updates to make things actually work.</li> </ul> <p>In an ideal world where everything is upstream and we understand ~all the hardware, DTs should be forwards- and backwards- compatible with software versions. That is, new features require everything to be up to date, but otherwise those new features simply won't be available.</p> <p>In the real world, * DT bindings that have not been upstreamed yet are subject to incompatible changes as they go through review. We try to avoid this, but it has happened (e.g. the AIC2 IRQ controller binding changed, which notably broke booting completely for older kernels on t600x). Sometimes we can have interim DTs that have both styles of data, to maintain compat. * m1n1 should degrade gracefully when it runs into missing DT structure for the changes it wants to patch in (i.e. m1n1 version &gt; DT version), but those code paths don't get much testing. Please file a bug if you see it abort or crash when it shouldn't. * The early days of U-Boot on any given SoC might see some changes in DT dependencies (e.g. MTP keyboard support for M2 platforms goes along with DT changes, though this will degrade gracefully if missing) * In principle, it's possible for a Linux driver to crash badly if m1n1 was not updated to initialize the hardware properly (and if it's not injecting any DT props, the driver won't bail due to missing them). We obviously try to handle errors gracefully, but it's conceivable that e.g. missing power- or memory controller-related init could cause something like a hard SoC wedge when Linux tried to bring up dependent hardware. Maybe we should start stuffing the m1n1 version in the DT, so drivers can bail if something is known unsafe with older versions? * There are some DT changes that hit corner cases in the \"full compat\" ideal and aren't very easy to fix. For example, if a DT node introduces a dependency on another node (e.g. a producer-consumer relationship), even if it were optional in principle, that driver may fail to probe (or not even attempt to probe) if the producer's driver is not available, can't probe, or does not implement the proper producer function. We also have issues with power domains: some are currently marked \"always-on\" because they break something badly if turned off, but in the future we might learn how to handle this properly. If that flag is removed in newer DTs, older kernels would be in trouble.</p> <p>Since you can have multiple kernels installed, you have to pick where you source your DTs somehow. The logical choice would be the most recent kernel. For Arch, since there is only ever one installed kernel with the standard package, we get to ignore this issue (for typical users) and just always update the DTs on package updates to that version.</p> <p>TL;DR: Update your DTs when you update your kernel (unless you know they weren't touched), and also update your m1n1 to make big new stuff work.</p>"},{"location":"alt/boot-process-guide/#build-instructions","title":"Build instructions","text":"<p>Assuming everything is done natively (no cross-compiling):</p>"},{"location":"alt/boot-process-guide/#m1n1","title":"m1n1","text":"<pre><code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1\ncd m1n1\nmake ARCH= RELEASE=1\n</code></pre> <p>Note: RELEASE=1 currently just turns off verbose log output by default.

The C environment is properly position-adjusted after those, so you should never see them there. However, if you're debugging m1n1 and printing pointers, and want to map those back to the raw ELF file, you will have to subtract the m1n1 load offset to get the unrelocated offset.</p> <p>Virtual addresses have no significance; this is just used because Mach-O has no concept of physical addresses, and the whole set-up assumes Darwin will map itself in a certain way. For our purposes, a vaddr is just <code>paddr + ba.virt_base - ba.phys_base</code>. m1n1 does not use top-half virtual addresses, and Linux does its own thing that has nothing to do with Darwin.</p> <p>In addition, there are two virtual address maps: whatever's in the Mach-O, and the pointers iBoot actually passes us. The latter is offset by the kASLR slide, which also affects vaddrs. This makes everything more confusing.</p> <p>Thus, for any Darwin kASLR-slid virtual pointer received from iBoot, we compute <code>vaddr - ba.virt_base + ba.phys_base</code> and that's all we care about; conversely, only the linker script (and the Mach-O header generation within) cares about Mach-O unslid virtual addresses.

Right now the practical significance is unclear, but presumably after a resume from deep sleep, the boot CPU will start executing code here.

Note that fresh executions of the Python side will re-initialize their heap starting at whatever the current m1n1 end is, so e.g. m1n1-side memory leaks on each Python execution are not an immediate problem until you run out of total RAM.</p> <p>When chainloading another Mach-O payload, the next stage overwrites m1n1 in-place. The chainload.py Mach-O loading code skips the padding end of the m1n1 payload section (except 4 zero bytes as a marker), so SEP firmware and BootArgs follow directly in what would've otherwise been the m1n1 payload area, saving RAM. Relocating the SEP firmware is optional; if it is not enabled, it remains where it is, and top_of_kdata is kept untouched.

Note 2: There doesn't seem to be a way to hold off the logical register write until later, so only logical registers of size \u2264 16 can be written atomically.</p> <p>Other observations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Only the first 0x60 addresses are mapped, but address bits 7 and higher seem to be ignored, causing the block to be aliased every 0x80 bytes.

This seems to allow the ACE3 to be accessed by two masters without fighting over the state of the interface (SPMI registers, interrupts, etc). In particular:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Each slave holds its own selection, even though they operate over the same logical registers. Each slave also seems to have some sort of cache for selections, which appears to be invalidated when the \"register 0 write\" command is used. By contrary, using a normal write to trigger a selection uses the cache and may return stale data: for example, logical registers may appear out of sync among the two slaves, and command execution (which involves writing a command to logical register 8) may appear to not finish, since subsequent reads of register 8 return the cached command rather than the result of the execution. Logical register writes are always committed immediately on writes to the 0x20..0x5F area, regardless how the selection was made.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each slave holds its own interrupt state: the \"AP slave\" uses register 0x14 for pending interrupts, register 0x16 for unmasked interrupts and register 0x18 to ACK interrupts. The other slave uses the same registers but shifted by +1 (0x15 for pending, 0x17 for unmasked, 0x19 for ACK). Drivers should be careful not to touch these (along with any other state owned by the secondary slave).</p> </li> <li> <p>Each slave holds its own sleeping state, but the ACE3 is only put to sleep if both slaves are in sleeping state. In this state, both slaves ignore writes to SPMI registers (but still ACK the commands). If at least one of the slaves is woken up, this doesn't happen (neither slave ignores writes). Whatever is using the secondary slave makes sure to only wake up the slave temporarily, perform the commands it needs to, and put it to sleep again. The \"AP slave\" is sleeping at boot.</p> </li> <li> <p>While the \"AP slave\" uses the SPMI interrupts documented above, the other slave uses the same interrupts but shifted by -1 (not +1). So for example selecting a register in the secondary slave causes a <code>BASE + 1</code> interrupt, the triggering of one of the interrupts in register 0x17 causes a <code>BASE - 1</code> interrupt, sending a sleep command to the secondary slave causes a <code>BASE + 5</code> interrupt and so on.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The secondary slave triggers abundant interrupts when e.g. plugging in a cable, making it clear something else is actually operating it. The fact that these interrupts make it to our SPMI controller hints at the interrupt delivery mechanism not being a \"master write\" command, since that's addressed to a single master and presumably the other user isn't using our SPMI controller but a separate SPMI master.</p>"},{"location":"hw/peripherals/camera/","title":"Camera and Image Signal Processor","text":""},{"location":"hw/peripherals/camera/#isp","title":"ISP","text":"<p>This information is based on Macbook Pro M1 2020 ISP.

There are up to 16 contexts (TODO: double check this limit is real and not driver-controlled), each with two base registers for the kernel/user page tables. </p> <p>macOS always uses context 0 for the kernel only (no user pages for that one) and shares the kernel half of the page tables for all contexts. User VA space is unique per context.</p> <p>The kernel address space literally maps ASC firmware too, as it is the ASC's CPU page table.

The host OS is responsible for the rest of the page tables in this half of the address space, which is where all the GPU control structures go.</p> <p>Note: firmware is loaded by the bootloader and write-protected.

Given that the controller implements pinmux functionality we need to model this hardware as a pinctrl node in the FDT.

For understanding the xART/Gigalocker creation and provisioning flow, creating a new user should provision new encryption keys for them which very likely would involve adding entries to the Gigalockers. Also goes without saying but the tracing should be done on the same macOS version as will be the firmware for Asahi Linux installs. (13.5 as of 11/13/2024) - Not fully true, SEP firmware is determined by the highest version macos to be ever installed on the device, but the protocol is backwards compatible.</p> <p>TODOs for tracing: - Massively reduce the message spam from the tracer over the Python console, it greatly slows down the system, and has led to panics on occasion as the message spam leads to things timing out. - currently the tracer seems to assume Monterey or Big Sur SEP firmware, update it for Ventura and newer. - Perhaps only trace SEP messages from individual SEP applets based on endpoint indices, and use separate Python scripts to trace the SKS flow or the SSE flow? - build a table of message types and data sent in for all endpoints (in XNU logs, a lot of the messages seem to have parts of the true SEP message masked out)</p> <p>Miscellaneous questions:</p> <ul> <li>when the debug endpoint is notifying the AP that an endpoint has come to life, the \"DATA\" field has a value of 0x2020202, 0x1010101, 0x0, or 0x2020404 - this is ool buffer sizes in pages, input and output. Not sure why they are doubled though.</li> <li>one part of the SEP shared mem buffer at the very beginning during endpoint setup changes the lower byte of the first 32-bit word from 02 to 1f. why would that be? is that a configuration bit? is that done by macOS or the SEP OS?</li> </ul> <p>Coprocessor information:</p> <p>As with other ASC coprocessors like DCP, this is an ASC coprocessor and thus communicates with the main AP through a similar mailbox interface and occasional shared buffers (in AppleSEPManager, they call these \"OOL\" buffers, supposedly out of line buffers). Unlike the other processors which run RTKit or a derivative of, SEP seems to run a custom OS Apple internally calls SEPOS. Additionally SEPOS itself seems to be broken up into many different applications that all run on the SEP itself.</p> <p>SEP seems to authenticate its own firmware (evidenced by kernel strings saying that SEP has \"accepted\" the IMG4), and seemingly will panic upon failure to authenticate the firmware. SEP firmware is encrypted by a separate GID from the normal AP GID, so a bootchain vuln in iBoot won't give you any ability to decrypt SEP firmware or load arbitrary SEP firmware unless you also manage to compromise SEP itself.</p> <p>Compared to the other ASC coprocessors, SEP is the only one that seems to have dedicated storage (at minimum for any sensitive information like wrapped keys and such) that no other processor on the device can talk to.</p> <p>T8112 ASC SEP mailbox base: 0x25E400000 (actual mailbox at +0x8000, like other ASC IOPs)</p> <p>Endpoint information:</p> Endpoint index Endpoint name Purpose 0x00 Control/CNTL seems to control some endpoint properties 0x08 Secure Biometrics (SBIO) biometric authentication 0x0a SCRD likely \"Secure/SEP credential manager\" used for user credential auth? 0x0c sse Somehow related to NFC, may be related to Apple Pay. 0x0e HDCP likely HDCP content protection 0x10 xars (according to tracer) xART setup? involved in startup/shutdown 0x12 Secure/SEP Key Store SEP encrypt/decrypt operations and key management 0x13 xART manager manages xARTs, gigalockers and keybags (needed for SKS to start) 0x14 hibe (according to tracer) hibernation related 0x15 pnon (tracer name) Boot policy related.

We do not have any expectations of direct support, documentation, or additional development effort from them, nor do we expect them to attempt to hinder third-party OSes in any deliberate way.

Apple Silicon machines are designed first and foremost to provide a secure environment for typical end-users running macOS as signed by Apple; they prioritize user security against third-party attackers, but also attempt to limit Apple's own control over the machines in order to reduce their responsibility when faced with government requests, to some extent. In addition, the design preserves security even when a third-party OS is installed. The entire architecture is complicated and the details subtle, but to summarize a few key points:</p> <ul> <li>Boot components are signed and opaque (encrypted)</li> <li>Runtime components (e.g. firmware and macOS itself) are signed and transparent (plaintext)<ul> <li>With the exception of the SEP (Secure Enclave Processor, a TPM equivalent), which is optional and disabled by default</li> <li>And two small blobs (SMC and PMU) which are merely incidentally encrypted; it would be nice to get Apple to disclose these, but they have a rather small I/O surface.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Brick recovery / total system flash (DFU) requires phoning home</li> <li>Normal operation, including OS installs, can be performed off-line with physical user presence. It is possible to take an out-of-the-box Mac and install Linux on it without ever connecting it to a network.</li> <li>Owner control is asserted on first boot (you become machine owner by going through the macOS setup flow and creating the first admin user).</li> <li>The normal bootloader flow is minimal and has a small attack surface (no USB, network, etc.)</li> <li>No runtime blobs are designed to have total system access (no ME, no PSP, no TrustZone, nothing of that sort). Almost all blobs are running behind IOMMUs or similar firewalls, with the sole exception of the GPU firmware*. All code running on the main CPUs is under the control of the OS.</li> </ul> <p>This puts them somewhere between x86 PCs and a libre-first system like the Talos II in terms of freedom to replace firmware and boot components; while a number of blobs are required in order to boot the system, none of those have the ability to take over the OS or compromise it post-boot (unlike, say, Intel ME and AMD PSP on recent systems, or the DMA-capable chips on the LPC bus running opaque blobs that exist on even old ThinkPads).</p> <p>AS machines use a large number of auxiliary firmware blobs, each dedicated to a specific purpose and running on a separate CPU core. This is better than having a smaller number of kitchen sink blobs (like Intel ME), since each blob can only affect a particular subsystem (e.g. display, storage, camera), which makes it harder for multiple blobs to collude in order to compromise the user in a meaningful way. For example, the blob running inside the keyboard controller has no mechanism to communicate with the blob running on the WiFi card, and thus cannot implement a keylogger surreptitiously; the blob running on the display controller similarly has no way to communicate with the network, and thus can't implement a secret screen scraper.</p> <p>From a security perspective, these machines may possibly qualify as the most secure general purpose computers available to the public which support third-party OSes, in terms of resistance to attack by non-owners. This is, of course, predicated on some level of trust in Apple, but some level of trust in the manufacturer is required for any system (there is no way to prove the non-existence of hardware backdoors on any machine, so this is not as much of a sticking point as it might initially seem).</p> <p>This design does make it somewhat more awkward for users to install a third-party OS than we're used to on other platforms (this is standard fare in order to protect against malware and users being misled into compromising their machines), and this is covered in the rest of this guide.</p> <p>On the licensing front:</p> <ul> <li>You do have to click through Apple's EULA in order to use the machines at all.</li> <li>Apple gives users explicit permission to run their own OS in their EULA.</li> <li>Apple does not give users permission to redistribute system firmware, but</li> <li>Apple provides all current and past versions of complete system images (firmware and macOS) on a well-known, unauthenticated HTTPS CDN, and</li> <li>Apple's EULA grants all Mac owners a license to use these images.</li> </ul> <p>As with all EULAs, there are some nonsensical points in Apple's (lawyers always seem to be out of sync with actual product direction and design), but reading between the lines we believe everything we're doing is kosher for practical purposes.</p> <p>* There is one exceptional blob that does have privileged access to the system (although it does not explicitly do anything questionable): the GPU firmware. This is because it is in charge of managing parts of the GPU page tables (which are also its own), and there is no separate upstream IOMMU in front of the GPU coprocessor like there is with other coprocessors. While this does extend the surface of system compromise to it, it's worth pointing out that this firmware is not particularly large, is shipped in plain text and even with some symbols, does not have any functionality to talk via questionable interfaces (network, etc.), and is optional and not running when the OS boots (the OS must explicitly start it). Therefore, users willing to forgo GPU functionality can choose not to use it. The firmware also implements a mitigation similar to the PPL in order to protect the GPU page tables even if it is compromised via exploitation (e.g. through GPU commands), although we do not believe this mechanism is currently hardened enough to be an effective mitigation; we look forward to further auditing the GPU firmware and hope Apple will work with us on issues found, so that we can reach a point where we can confidently say that it would be difficult or impossible to use a runtime vulnerability in it to escalate to full system memory access. Update: As of macOS 13.0, the GPU firmware is significantly hardened (in part thanks to Lina's discovery and report of CVE-2022-32947). We are not yet shipping 13.0+ firmware for Asahi, but we will soon Asahi now ships with firmware 13.5, which significantly increases our confidence in this part of the system. Nonetheless, at this time, we have no reason to believe that there are any backdoors in the existing 12.3/12.4 firmwares we use, or that exploiting them is possible from Linux.</p>"},{"location":"platform/introduction/#storage","title":"Storage","text":"<p>AS platforms have two main kinds of storage: NOR Flash and NVMe.</p> <p>NOR is formatted as raw regions and contains:</p> <ul> <li>1st stage bootloader (iBoot1/LLB)</li> <li>System-global firmware</li> <li>Platform configuration data (syscfg, read-only)</li> <li>Factory test logs</li> <li>NVRAM (config variables, read-write)</li> </ul> <p>NVMe is a GPT volume and contains:</p> <ul> <li>System-global storage (iBoot System Container; iSC) including:<ul> <li>Boot policies (think boot configs, but secure) (Preboot)</li> <li>SEP secure storage (xARTS)</li> <li>Misc system config data</li> </ul> </li> <li>One or more APFS container partitions<ul> <li>Each containing one or more bootable OSes sharing a container, each comprising<ul> <li>Preboot volume subfolder<ul> <li>2nd stage bootloader (iBoot2)</li> <li>Apple Device Tree</li> <li>OS-paired firmware</li> <li>OS kernel (XNU)</li> </ul> </li> <li>OS-paired recoveryOS image (in Recovery volume)</li> <li>Per-OS root &amp; data filesystem volumes (may be empty)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>System-global recoveryOS image (+ optional fallback)</li> </ul> <p>There are no restrictions on additional partitions and types; they are ignored by Apple's tooling.</p> <p>Note that the system does not use an EFI system partition (and does not run EFI).

OS installs exist in APFS containers following the expected OS layout (multiple OSes can be present in one APFS container).</p> <p>Since iBoot has no mechanism for booting from external devices, upon selecting an external OS to boot, the boot picker will copy that OS's Preboot structure into NVMe, create a Boot Policy for it, and then configure iBoot1 to boot from that instead. The copied parts include everything up to the XNU kernel itself, including iBoot2 and firmware. This means that external storage is only initialized once XNU is already running, and it will merely mount its root filesystem from there, having been booted from NVMe. Note that, since this process requires the creation of a new Boot Policy (that will not be in the appropriate security state, nor can it be put into it at that point due to pairing requirements), it cannot be used to boot fuOS kernels installed on external drives in this manner (at least not without further manual action, but it's unclear whether this would be possible at all).</p> <p>OS installers are identified by a magic <code>.IAPhysicalMedia</code> plist at the root of the volume, and may exist on volumes of any supported filesystem (APFS and FAT32 both work).

As the machines natively support multi-boot, and in order to fit within the security design of the platform (e.g. the SEP should know what OS was booted), we recommend a 1:1 mapping between an installed OS and an OS as seen by the platform.</p> <p>For third-party OSes, we propose the following GPT partition structure per OS:</p> <ol> <li>APFS container partition (\"stub macOS\") (~2.5GB) with:<ul> <li>iBoot2, firmware, XNU kernel, RecoveryOS (all required by the platform)</li> <li>m1n1 as fuOS kernel, with chainloading config pointing to the EFI partition</li> <li>~empty root/data filesystem subvolumes</li> </ul> </li> <li>EFI system partition (FAT32) (~512MB) with:<ul> <li>m1n1 stage 2 + device trees + U-Boot</li> <li>GRUB or another UEFI OS loader boot the target kernel</li> </ul> </li> <li>root/boot/etc. partitions (OS-specific)</li> </ol> <p>Rationale: this arrangement pairs together a third-party OS with an APFS-resident OS as seen by Apple's tooling, and allows users to use the native boot picker (with a11y support). It avoids potential trouble down the road which could come from having multiple OSes attempt to manage the SEP under a shared OS context. It also lets us have independent secure-boot chains for OSes (once that is implemented), with the fuOS image containing the root of trust for subsequent boot stages, bridged to the machine chain of trust by the user with their machine owner credentials during installation.</p> <p>While it would be possible to share one APFS container between multiple OSes (and even macOS), there isn't much point to this other than saving a small amount of disk space per OS. Using a separate container partition for each installed OS makes it easier to wipe and start over, which would otherwise require a more complicated cleanup process where certain APFS subvolumes are deleted and certain directory trees in others are wiped.</p> <p>This design, unconventionally, provides an EFI system partition for each installed OS. There are two reasons for this: first, each OS is logically a \"container\" and includes the EFI implementation itself, so it makes sense to isolate the ESP from that of other OSes. Second, due to the absence of EFI variable runtime services (see below), it would be difficult for multiple co-existing OSes to share an ESP and configure their respective EFI boot entries. Having separate ESPs allows us to just use the default boot path (<code>\\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTAA64.EFI</code>) and avoid having to persist boot configurations. It also allows the ESP to be directly used as the <code>/boot</code> partition for an OS, without having multiple OSes colliding with each other (if desired).</p> <p>In the future, once open APFS drivers are deemed stable enough to use as a root filesystem, we would like to support full space-sharing coexistence with macOS; at that point only the EFI system partition would be required on top of an existing APFS macOS container.</p> <p>Due to the presence of multiple ESPs, OSes will need a way to figure out which is theirs. For typical mounts and boot purposes, that can be done with partition/FS IDs; this should mostly be a concern for OS installers which need to determine what ESP to install their bootloader into at installation time.

As the machines natively support multi-boot, and in order to fit within the security design of the platform (e.g. the SEP should know what OS was booted), we recommend a 1:1 mapping between an installed OS and an OS as seen by the platform.</p> <p>For third-party OSes, we propose the following GPT partition structure per OS:</p> <ol> <li>APFS container partition (\"stub macOS\") (~2.5GB) with:<ul> <li>iBoot2, firmware, XNU kernel, RecoveryOS (all required by the platform)</li> <li>m1n1 as fuOS kernel, with chainloading config pointing to the EFI partition</li> <li>~empty root/data filesystem subvolumes</li> </ul> </li> <li>EFI system partition (FAT32) (~512MB) with:<ul> <li>m1n1 stage 2 + device trees + U-Boot</li> <li>GRUB or another UEFI OS loader boot the target kernel</li> </ul> </li> <li>root/boot/etc. partitions (OS-specific)</li> </ol> <p>Rationale: this arrangement pairs together a third-party OS with an APFS-resident OS as seen by Apple's tooling, and allows users to use the native boot picker (with a11y support). It avoids potential trouble down the road which could come from having multiple OSes attempt to manage the SEP under a shared OS context. It also lets us have independent secure-boot chains for OSes (once that is implemented), with the fuOS image containing the root of trust for subsequent boot stages, bridged to the machine chain of trust by the user with their machine owner credentials during installation.</p> <p>While it would be possible to share one APFS container between multiple OSes (and even macOS), there isn't much point to this other than saving a small amount of disk space per OS. Using a separate container partition for each installed OS makes it easier to wipe and start over, which would otherwise require a more complicated cleanup process where certain APFS subvolumes are deleted and certain directory trees in others are wiped.</p> <p>This design, unconventionally, provides an EFI system partition for each installed OS. There are two reasons for this: first, each OS is logically a \"container\" and includes the EFI implementation itself, so it makes sense to isolate the ESP from that of other OSes. Second, due to the absence of EFI variable runtime services (see below), it would be difficult for multiple co-existing OSes to share an ESP and configure their respective EFI boot entries. Having separate ESPs allows us to just use the default boot path (<code>\\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTAA64.EFI</code>) and avoid having to persist boot configurations. It also allows the ESP to be directly used as the <code>/boot</code> partition for an OS, without having multiple OSes colliding with each other (if desired).</p> <p>In the future, once open APFS drivers are deemed stable enough to use as a root filesystem, we would like to support full space-sharing coexistence with macOS; at that point only the EFI system partition would be required on top of an existing APFS macOS container.</p> <p>Due to the presence of multiple ESPs, OSes will need a way to figure out which is theirs. For typical mounts and boot purposes, that can be done with partition/FS IDs; this should mostly be a concern for OS installers which need to determine what ESP to install their bootloader into at installation time.

All system files are, at minimum, signed and hashed by Apple. Critical firmware components, such as sepOS (and in older versions, iBoot) are also encrypted. The system verifies the integrity of all of these components before they are allowed to execute. If any of these components fail verification for any reason, the system will fail to boot and direct the user to restore their machine.</p> <p>This model extends from the firmware and bootloader up into macOS itself. The SEP maintains a Boot Policy for each APFS container, which enrolls a macOS kernelcache and system data volume allowed to be booted. The kernelcache is signed by Apple, and its hash is recorded in the SEP's Boot Policy. If the hash of the provided kernelcache is mismatched with the one in the SEP's Boot Policy or it has not been signed by Apple, the system will refuse to boot that APFS container.</p> <p>The OS snapshot itself is a hashed disk image. Every file inside it is also hashed, and the Merkle tree of these hashes is used to compute a final hash known as the Volume Seal which is used to sign the volume. If the hash of the image itself or the seal does not match the SEP's Boot Policy, then the system will not boot. Mutable user data is stored on an entirely different volume on the container, and is unioned with the snapshot to be presented as a single filesystem to the user only after the snapshot has been verified.

You.</p> <p>The user's interaction with the SEP forms the ultimate trust root for the platform's security model.  Upon initial setup of an Apple Silicon machine, the SEP enrolls a set of \"Machine Owner\" credentials,  which are the credentials of the first macOS account set up on the machine in a Full Security container. This set of Machine Owner credentials is used to authenticate and sign any operations that alter the state of a container's security or boot policy.

One of these states, 1TR, can only ever be entered from a cold boot by holding the physical power button, and authenticating with Machine Owner credentials. If the SEP is not satisfied that both these conditions have been intentionally met (e.g. the power button is released prematurely), then it will not register a 1TR boot. Security operations such as demoting a container to Permissive Security can only be done from 1TR.

It is for this reason that Apple cannot replace faulty SSDs in post-T2 Macs without total data loss. The default state for this system is data encrypted at rest - the machine will transparently decrypt the data in flight with its own keys, while it remains encrypted on the disk. There is almost no performance penalty for this. On Apple Silicon machines, the SEP generates a Volume Encryption Key (VEK) and eXtended Anti-Replay Token (xART) for each APFS volume. The xART prevents replay attacks from capturing the VEK, which is stored in the SEP's own airgapped memory and can never be read by the application cores to further harden it against capture.</p> <p>Data on the volume is encrypted/decrypted in flight. sepOS passes the keys directly to the NVMe controller, bypassing the application cores to harden against key capture. It is important to be aware that once the machine has powered on and the SEP is satisfied with the state of iBoot and the system firmware, the keys are unwrapped and all data is accessible in the clear across all partitions. This is where FileVault comes in for macOS.</p> <p>When FileVault is enabled for an APFS volume, the VEK and xART are wrapped with a Key Encryption Key (KEK), which is backed by user credentials from the macOS container in question. The machine will be unable to read the user data volume of the protected container until these credentials are provided at startup. Enabling this is instantaneous on Apple Silicon machines, since the only required operation is generating the KEK and a recovery key. The system snapshot, Preboot, and recovery volumes are not protected by FileVault. These partitions are immutable, backed by the SEP, and contain no user data and therefore do not particularly benefit from FileVault. All encryption keys are destroyed by the SEP when the Machine Owner requests the machine to be wiped, guaranteeing that any residual data is indecipherable even to data recovery programs.</p> <p>We can very emulate this with LUKS on top of LVM and achieve effective full disk encryption. We have the luxury of disregarding the APFS stub since the only things we care about there are m1n1 and recoveryOS, both of which are verified, signed and tamper-proof. An existing weakness is that <code>/boot</code> must be stored in the clear, and there is currently no Secure Boot or Measured Boot analogue with which we can guarantee the integrity of the kernel or initramfs. Users may choose to point their bootloader to removeable media once this is better supported to mitigate this.

Rumours circulating that Apple are actively hostile towards efforts such as Asahi, or that their security must be bypassed or jailbroken to run untrusted code are unfounded and false.

Unfortunately, this interacts poorly with WirePlumber/Pipewire and does not seem to respect node graph permissions.

Find the cause for this and fix the issue. This tasks is a little annoying since m1n1's hypervisor clobbers the hardware uart0 for its own use. janne Keyboard layout cleanup (XKB/hid_apple) Unclaimed Apple keyboard support across the Linux desktop stack has been hit-and-miss, across layouts and hardware keyboards. Since our keyboard drivers are not upstream yet, we have the chance to do some major cleanup. In particular, the keyboards on these machines have a soft Fn key that is handled entirely in software. The <code>hid_apple</code> driver currently does this in the kernel, but this is the wrong approach. This key should be handled in userspace in XKB/Wayland (Xorg cannot do it, but it's deprecated), so that we can have more comprehensive Fn key mappings including letting users customize the key bindings like they would any other modifier key, or offer special symbols like macOS does. This should probably be done by introducing new XKB keyboard models, which do this mapping in userspace. To test this, use the <code>fnmode=0</code> module parameter for <code>hid_apple</code> to disable all Fn key processing. We will later want to introduce a new fnmode that only does Fn key combination emulation for the edit keys (insert/delete/home/end/pgup/pgdown), which is the minimum required for a usable TTY and Xorg, and leave the rest to XKB, defaulting to this mode on Apple Silicon machines. Besides the Fn story, there are also many regional Mac layouts that need to be fixed in XKB configuration, and everyone with a non-English keyboard is welcome to help out with that effort.

Another person might want to test using the Mac Mini as a networked build machine, for which they would probably only want networking, pstates, and a <code>cpufreq</code> driver. For people like this, \"done\" could very well mean whenever the specific feature they require lands in the <code>linux-asahi</code> kernel branch.

Each user queue has a parent VM. A user queue receives jobs for execution, and each job can be composed of up to 64 GPU commands (to guarantee we don't exceed certain firmware limitations). Jobs are scheduled by the <code>drm_sched</code> scheduler and support arbitrary in/out sync object lists, for explicit sync. The job does not start execution until all the in sync objects are signaled, and the out sync objects are all signaled when all commands in the job have fully completed. Jobs are submitted to the firmware as soon as all in sync objects are signaled: a job boundary does NOT imply a CPU round trip if there are no direct dependencies between them (though the GPU will asynchronously signal completion of each job, since the kernel needs to clean up resources). However, jobs are always submitted in order: unsatisfied in sync objects for a job will block submission of all subsequent jobs to the firmware (this is implied by <code>drm_sched</code> and also a hard requirement of the driver design as it stands today). True arbitrary concurrency/reordering requires using multiple queues.</p> <p>Within a job, commands are directly queued for execution by the firmware without CPU involvement. Each user queue is logically composed of two logical queues: render and compute. Render commands and compute commands are submitted in sequence, but they can execute concurrently within a single user queue.</p> <p>The logical render queue is backed by two firmware queues (vertex and fragment). The kernel always submits firmware commands in pairs to those, with a barrier between them. This barrier is permeable (insert handwavy firmware magic here \u2728) in that partial renders and preemption can interleave partial vertex and fragment executions. Vertex/fragment barriers between individual draw commands, if necessary, are handled at the VDM level (in the GPU command stream), as are certain cache-related barriers.</p> <p>Within a user queue, command dependencies can be optionally added. These are specified as the boundary index (think Python slice indexing) of the command to wait on for each logical queue (compute, render), per command. Indices start at 0 (the point before any commands from this submission) and increment by one for every submitted command of a given type. It is illegal to wait on a command boundary in the future. Waiting on index 0 (the beginning of the job) for a given logical queue means waiting for all commands part of prior jobs of that type to complete, that is, it is equivalent to waiting on the end boundary of the prior submission. Since logical queues always start and complete commands in sequence, waiting on a given index implies waiting on all prior commands for that logical queue.</p> <p>Absent explicit barriers, the vertex half of render commands can run concurrently with the fragment half of prior commands. That is, vertex processing can \"run ahead\" of fragment processing. To prevent this, specify a command barrier of the previous command index. This is a no-op for compute, since there is only a single serialized firmware queue in that case, but has meaning for render commands, and it is recommended for compute commands in case more parallelization becomes available in the future.</p> <p>Consider the following submission:</p> <pre><code>#0  R1 barrier=[__, C0]\n#1  C1 barrier=[__, __]\n#2  C2 barrier=[__, __]\n#3  R2 barrier=[R1, C2]\n#4  R3 barrier=[__, __] # [R1, C2] implied\n#5  R4 barrier=[R3, __] # [R3, C2] implied\n</code></pre> <p>This describes the following dependency graph:</p> <pre><code>[C*]-&gt;[R1]----+----\\\n   [C1]------+|---vv\n   [C2]-----+||-&gt;[R3]-v\n            vvv      [R4]\n            [R2]------^\n</code></pre> <p>Note that there is a C1&lt;-C2 ordering in practice due to queue serialization, but this wasn't explicitly specified with barriers. However, R2 and R3 are ordered after C2 and all prior compute commands, which includes C1, and also ordered after R1. Also note that R2/R3 can run concurrently (which means that vertex processing for R3 can overlap with or precede fragment processing for R2), but R4 will not start its vertex half until R3 is fully complete (which implies that R2 is also complete, due to queue ordering).</p> <p><code>[C*]</code> is the last submitted compute command (from a prior job). Note that specifying a 0 barrier is legal even if no commands have been submitted yet (it is ignored in that case, as it is equivalent to the case where all prior commands have fully completed at the driver and the associated ordering primitives freed). In this case, R1 could start its vertex processing before a previous submission's fragment processing is complete (no render barrier), but would wait for any prior compute commands to be complete (C0 barrier).</p> <p>The firmware queue view of the same job is:</p> <pre><code>Compute  Vertex    Fragment\nRUN C1   WAIT C0   WAIT R1v\nRUN C2   RUN  R1v  RUN  R1f\n         WAIT R1f  WAIT R2v\n         WAIT C2   RUN  R2f\n         RUN R2v   WAIT R3v\n         RUN R3v   RUN  R3f\n         WAIT R3f  WAIT R4v\n         RUN R4v   RUN  R4f\n</code></pre> <p>In other words: for every render command, the explicit barrier waits go in the vertex queue before the vertex half, then the fragment queue always gets an implicit barrier before the fragment half.</p> <p>Blit command support will be added in a future driver. These are effectively fragment-only render commands, and so will have their explicit barriers and execution both within the fragment queue.</p> <p>Right now, the Gallium driver only issues single-command submissions and always uses <code>[C0, R0]</code> barriers to fully serialize everything. This might be improved in the future, but the main use case for all this is Vulkan queues.</p>"},{"location":"sw/agx-driver-notes/#results","title":"Results","text":"<p>Userspace can optionally request feedback from command execution.

In particular, we aim for:</p> <ul> <li>A balanced (neutral) tone at moderate listening volumes, with a mostly flat frequency response from a typical listening position</li> <li>Reasonably high peak volume with acceptable sound degradation (compression, limiting, etc.)</li> <li>\"Fake bass\" processing to make audible frequencies that cannot be physically reproduced by the speakers, extending the perceived frequency response of the system. </li> <li>Equal-loudness volume compensation, so that the sound does not become noticeably tinny as the system master volume is lowered.</li> </ul> <p>These are all techniques that are in wide use in consumer microspeaker systems in tablets and phones, though sadly not common on laptops from most non-Apple brands. All of these processing tricks are also used by macOS.</p> <p>Our goal is explicitly not to clone the full/exact macOS audio experience. We consider the macOS speaker DSP processing to be too tryhard; some of the things it does work well, some do not (or are outright buggy!), and some are just strange. Although audio is ultimately subjective, and we recognize that some people might prefer the \"macOS sound\", we aim for a more objectively neutral and balanced sound than macOS as a baseline. Users are encouraged to try adding their own effects (e.g. with EasyEffects) if they want to customize their experience and achieve certain sonic profiles. We believe that a balanced baseline that allows users to shape the sound to their own preference if they so desire is a better option than hard-coding specific effects (such as macOS' spatial audio processing) with no option to turn them off. There is no user-friendly (GUI) way to modify or tweak our DSP chains, so it's best if additional effects are left to existing utilities like EasyEffects that can be easily customized by the user.</p> <p>That said, for the types of processing we do intend to apply, failing to work properly where macOS does (e.g. objectively bad audio quality for certain kinds of inputs in particular, such as bad-sounding compression or distortion at high volumes where macOS sounds better at an equal output volume) is considered a bug. Feel free to file issues if you find test cases where macOS does a clearly better job. We're particularly talking about program-dependent problems here, not \"I like the macOS EQ/spatial/whatever stuff better in general\".</p>"},{"location":"sw/audio-userspace/#smart-amp-safety-support","title":"\"Smart Amp\" / safety support","text":"<p>In addition to the DSP processing, we also have the world's first (as far as we know) open source \"smart amp\" implementation. This allows the speakers to be driven to much higher peak levels than the worst-case safe volume level, greatly extending their dynamic range. Our implementation, speakersafetyd, monitors feedback signals from the amplifiers, estimates speaker voice coil temperature using a two-stage thermal model, and reduces the hardware speaker volumes when the speakers get too warm. We also have kernel-side interlocks to disable or limit speaker volumes if speakersafetyd is not running or non-responsive.</p> <p>Right now, we are shipping with a hard volume reduction limit of -7dBFS to catch potential bugs or misbehavior. If you notice that your speakers cut off for approximately one second and then come back at a reduced volume level, it is likely that you triggered this safety limit. Stop playback to let the speakers cool down (just in case) and let the limit re-arm, and then check <code>/var/lib/speakersafetyd/blackbox</code> for any blackbox dumps and file a bug attaching them together with any speakersafetyd logs (try <code>journalctl -S '10m ago' -u speakersafetyd</code>). If you play full-scale test tones or \"extreme\" music at maximum volume, it is expected that you will hit this limit and trigger a blackbox dump / panic. This is intended to help catch any badness while playing normal music, and we will remove this conservative limit once we are confident in the software stack (speakersafetyd has other safety limits built in and will gain more over time).</p> <p>You can watch speakersafetyd in action by using <code>sudo journalctl -fu speakersafetyd</code>. As a rule of thumb, with the speaker volume at max, you should expect speakersafetyd not to kick in when playing loudness-normalized music (e.g. YouTube). Playing overly loud music without normalization (e.g. increasing the browser app volume to 100% in the Plasma applet while using YouTube, which bypasses the normalization limit it applies, or using media players without normalization) is likely to trigger some gain reduction from speakersafetyd, but it should not hit the -7 dB panic limit unless it's something ridiculous.</p> <p>WARNING: Speaker safety models have yet to be fully validated on all models. We are enabling audio only on models where we are confident things are ready and safe to use. If you use any undocumented overrides to force-enable speakers on any other machine models, you are entirely on your own and may very well blow up your speakers.</p>"},{"location":"sw/audio-userspace/#distro-integration-notes","title":"Distro integration notes","text":"<p>Requirements according to asahi-audio's README.md.</p> <p>The correct deployment order is asahi-audio/speakersafetyd &gt; (whatever you use to get those installed for users, e.g. metapackage) &gt; kernel.

At this point, we believe this is an interim fix to work around the worst case situation affecting single-boot Ventura users (see the last section of this document), and NOT yet a complete fix. Multi-boot and (to a lesser extent) Asahi Linux users are still affected in the same way. We expect a major/complete fix will likely arrive with the Sonoma 14.2 release (currently in beta, not yet fixed in beta 1).</p> <p>Update: We have made changes to the Asahi Installer, to our bootloader m1n1, and to asahi-nvram. At this time, we believe installing or having installed Asahi should not introduce any additional danger over a plain vanilla Sonoma upgrade on a single-boot machine.</p> <p>macOS Sonoma and macOS Ventura 13.6 were released with multiple serious bugs in their upgrade and boot process. Combined, these bugs can create conditions where a machine always boots to a black screen, no matter what power button press combination is used. This leaves users stuck, and the only solution is to use DFU recovery.</p> <p>This bug can affect users both with and without Asahi Linux installed.</p> <p>This situation can happen with certain settings on certain models, when multiple macOS versions are installed side by side (one Sonoma, one earlier). Since Asahi Linux behaves as if it were macOS 12.3/12.4/13.5 (depending on model and installation time), dual-boot installs of macOS Sonoma and Asahi Linux have the same effect. For macOS 13.6, this situation doesn't even require a dual-boot system, and can be triggered stand-alone as the only installed OS.</p> <p>We have updated the Asahi Linux installer to automatically perform an integrity check and diagnose your system on startup. To run it, paste this command into Terminal in macOS:</p> <p><code>curl https://alx.sh | sh</code></p> <p>You can quit the installer once you reach the main menu, without making any changes to your system.</p> <p>Apple bug reports: FB13319681 and FB13319708 and FB13313702 </p>"},{"location":"sw/sonoma-display-bug/#what-are-the-bugs-exactly","title":"What are the bugs exactly","text":"<p>There are two bugs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>macOS Sonoma upgrades use the previously installed version as System Recovery.

This is because our Linux display driver can fortuitously recover from the misconfigured display scenario, while the macOS driver can't.

Then, just pass <code>root=/dev/nvme0n1p5</code> (substitute whatever your rootfs partition number is; 5 is the typical number for vanilla installs) to boot directly into the system.</p>"},{"location":"sw/tethered-boot/#booting-a-kernel-under-the-hypervisor","title":"Booting a kernel under the hypervisor","text":"<p>Use this utility script to properly boot a Linux kernel under the m1n1 hypervisor:</p> <pre><code>tools/run_guest_kernel.sh /path/to/linux/build/dir 'earlycon rootwait root=/dev/nvme0n1p5' [optional initramfs]\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the script expects the path to the Linux build tree (i.e. the directory where <code>.config</code> and <code>Makefile</code> are).
