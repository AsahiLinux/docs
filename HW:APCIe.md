The PCIe host bridge includes at least some Synopsys DesignWare derived logic.  The release version encoded at offset 0x8f8/0x8fc in PCIE config space indicates version 530*-ea15 (5.30a-ea15).

## Tunables

The following set of tunables operate on config space of the per-port PCIe bridge devices.

### pcie-rc-tunables
On the 2020 M1 mini, this set of register writes modifies some bits on standardized capability structures as well as some other registers.
| register | capability | effect |
|----------|------------|--------|
| 0x194    | L1 PM Substates | clear Port Common_Mode_Restore_Time |
|          |                 | clear Port T_POWER_ON Scale |
|          |                 | clear Port T_POWER_ON Value |
| 0x2a4    | Data Link Feature | clear Data Link Feature Exchange Enable |
| 0xb80    |             | not part of an (extended) capability structure |
| 0xb84    |             | not part of an (extended) capability structure |
| 0x78     | PCI Express | clear Max_Read_Request_Size |

### pcie-rc-gen3-shadow-tunables

|          |                       | set Upstream Port 8.0 GT/s Transmitter Preset |
| 0x890    |            | not part of an (extended) capability structure |
|          |            | appears to be the Synopsys Designware PCIe GEN3_RELATED register |
| 0x8a8    |            | not part of an (extended) capability structure |
|          |            | appears to be the Synopsys Designware PCIe GEN3_EQ_CONTROL register |

### pcie-rc-gen4-shadow-tunables
| register | capability | effect |
|----------|------------|--------|
| 0x178    | Physical Layer 16.0 GT/s | set Downstream Port 16.0 GT/s Transmitter Preset |
|          |                          | set Upstream Port 16.0 GT/s Transmitter Preset |
| 0x890    |            | not part of an (extended) capability structure |
|          |            | (see above) |
| 0x8a8    |            | not part of an (extended) capability structure |
|          |            | (see above) |

So the changes to documented registers seem to disable some (buggy?) features as well do some lane equalization tuning. Maybe Apple hopes to re-enable this in a future respin of the silicon without having to specify specific silicon revs in their xnu driver?

## DT bindings

Apart from the `apple,msi-base-vec` and `apple,msi-num-vecs` properties these are all standard bindings.  The `apple,msi-base-vec` and `apple,msi-num-vecs` proprties follow an existing pattern, matching for example `arm,msi-base-spi` and `loongson,msi-base-vec`.

Some open questions remain:
* Which register blocks should we expose?  The ADT has a grand total of 17 register sets.  It makes sense to leave out the "fuses" register set sine m1n1 will readand apply those and they're not part of the APCIe hardware block.  The example above exposes the same set of registers as Corellium did, but with the length adjusted to what is in the ADT.  That is more or less the minimum set we need to bring up the PCIe links.  The use of `reg-names` means that we can add more sets later.
* How do we enable the WiFi/BT PCIe device?  This device needs to be explicitly enabled through the SMC before it shows up as a PCIe device.  It has been suggested that this is how Apple implements "Airplane Mode" and there is a separate "amfm" node in the ADT for this.  So maybe it makes sense to have some sort of rfkill device/node that takes care of this.  Hopefully this means the APCIe device gets an interrupt when it is turned on such that we can (re)train the PCIe link.

This proposed binding has been successfully implemented/tested in u-boot and OpenBSD.  However, we still need clock, pinctrl/gpio and DART bindings to make this all work.
