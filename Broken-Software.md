This page lists software that is known not to work correctly on Apple Silicon machines.
We publish it in the hope that it incentivizes inclined members of the community to contribute
fixes for the affected packages upstream, bettering the AArch64 software ecosystem for everyone.

### If ${PACKAGE} supports AArch64, why doesn't it work?
This is almost always due to incorrect/incomplete support for 16K pages.
Packages are sometimes built assuming a 4K page size, or are otherwise incompatible
with large pages. This has not been a serious issue for desktop Linux software, as
x86/amd64 supports only 4K pages and PowerPC supports only 4K _or_ 64K pages.
AArch64 is unique in that an AArch64 machine can use 4K, 16K _or_ 64K pages.

### Why not just use 4K pages then?
While these machines can boot 4K kernels, doing so requires some very hacky patches,
as the IOMMUs only support 16K-aligned pages. Not only does this cause severe performance
penalties, but it does not address the actual problem which is userspace software with
incomplete support for AArch64. XNU (macOS) gets around this by supporting independent
page sizes in userspace, however we have no such mechanism in Linux and likely never will.

### Why not just host a fixed version of ${PACKAGE} yourself?
Desktop-class AArch64 machines are only going to become more common in the next few years.
By having an upstream-first policy we can make sure these fixes are propagated to everyone
via distro repositories, improving the AArch64 ecosystem for everyone! See [Fixed packages](#fixed-packages)
for a list of software that has been fixed for everyone as a result of this. You wouldn't
want us to keep Emacs all to ourselves now, would you?

### Why does "not work" sometimes mean "instantly segfault"?
If an ELF executable or library has sections which are not aligned to 16K pages, the loader
will be unable to map the binary into memory and will signal this failure by causing
a segmentation fault before the program even technically starts execution.

You can confirm that this is the case using `readelf -l /path/to/binary`. All program
header sections of type `LOAD` must have an `ALIGN` value of at least `0x4000` to
successfully load on a 16K machine like Apple Silicon. The library illustrated here
is only aligned for 4K pages (`0x1000`) so it cannot load.

```
$ readelf -l lib64/ld-android.so

Though the default for AArch64 compilers is to produce ELF files with sections aligned
to 64K for compatibility with all AArch64 machines, tooling bugs (such as binaries
manipulated by old versions of `patchelf`) or customized compiler flags (such as
many Google programs, including older versions of Chrome (and Electron) and most current
Android programs) may result in a binary whose sections are only aligned to 4K.

## Broken packages
| Package | Upstream report | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ----- |
| box64 | https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/issues/384 | Does not support 16K pages in generic builds, therefore is as good as broken as far as shipping in distros goes. Needs multi-pagesize support to work out of the box. |
| [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/issues/1085) or any project using `jemallocator` crate    | https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/issues/1085 | Same reason as jemalloc (also almost always statically linked) |
| FEX | https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/issues/1921 | Not likely to be fixed in the near future. \* |
| hardened_malloc | https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/issues/183 | There are more changes necessary to hardened_malloc before 16k page support is done. It is also not a high priority at the moment as we need MTE |
| jemalloc | https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/467 | Upstream unwilling to fix, Needs build options if compiled on a 4k page size system. Addressed in [ArchLinuxARM](https://github.com/archlinuxarm/PKGBUILDs/pull/1914). |
| MEGAsync | https://github.com/meganz/MEGAsync/pull/801 |
| notion-app(-enhancer) | https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-repackaged/issues/107 | electron + broken build flags |
| Wine | https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52715 |
| Zig | https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/11308 | 

\* In the future, running x86-64 software will be supported via a 4k page size microVM running FEX.
