You can check out the [progress](progress) we've made so far.

Otherwise, we're happily accepting financial support on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/marcan) and [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/marcan). 

Of course we're also excited about any other support in the form of PR's, issues, feature requests, etc.

Once the project gets started in the new year, we will update this page with further information.
