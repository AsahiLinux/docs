This page has been broken up into a separate page for each generation of available devices, as there are now too many to list on a single
page. Each page below follows the same format as the old unified page.

- [M1 Series (M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, M1 Ultra) Feature Support](m1.md)
- [M2 Series (M2, M2 Pro, M2 Max, M2 Ultra) Feature Support](m2.md)
- [M3 Series (M3, M3 Pro, M3 Max) Feature Support](m3.md)
- [M4 Series (M4, M4 Pro, M4 Max) Feature Support](m4.md)
