Welcome to the Asahi Linux documentation! Here, you will find documentation on the
Apple Silicon platform as implemented on Mac computers with M-series SoCs. We aim
to document the platform in a way that is useful for everyone, however our focus is
supporting third-party operating systems, particularly Linux.

We also have documentation on the various pieces of software required to properly
support this platform, such as m1n1 and U-Boot. Documentation for software that we
have created (such as m1n1) aims to be as complete as possible. Documentation for
external projects (such as U-Boot) is limited to how that software is used on the
Apple Silicon platform.

## Who this documentation is for
- Operating system and kernel developers looking to implement support for Apple Silicon
- Folks interested in hacking on and reverse engineering the Apple Silicon platform
- End users looking for guides and information on supported features
- Anyone interested in the Asahi Linux project looking for more information

Questions? Please check out the [FAQ](project/faq.md) first!

## Developers
We have extensive documentation on the platform itself, and the tooling we use to
reverse engineer and develop Linux drivers for it. Check out the sidebar for places
to start!

## End Users
Check out [Feature Support](platform/feature-support/overview.md) for supported devices
and features. If you're after documentation on something specific, use the search feature
at the top of the page or check out the sidebar for places to start!
