The primary supported distribution is the [Fedora Asahi Remix](https://asahilinux.org/fedora/), but several members of the community have contributed guides and pre-built artifacts in order to use other distros on Apple Silicon Macs. These efforts are listed here. Please remember that these are user-contributed, and the Asahi Linux project cannot provide support or any guarantee of compatibility, functionality, or safety.
